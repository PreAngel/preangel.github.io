LeyLine is building the world’s first AI-native video platform, empowering anyone, anywhere, to create and share cinematic stories with the help of intelligent tools that understand aesthetic, tone, and narrative.

The company was founded on a simple belief: creativity should not be limited by access. Its origin traces back to the founder’s experience in Hollywood, where immense talent often went unseen—not for lack of imagination, but because of the barriers of budget, tools, and opportunity. LeyLine exists to change that.

By combining AI-powered video generation with a streaming-native distribution layer, LeyLine enables creators to go from idea to audience in minutes—without editing skills, rendering time, or expensive equipment.

Designed to be fast, beautiful, and global by default, LeyLine represents the next generation of creative technology. Its mission is to eliminate the barriers to premium content creation, enabling independent creators, studios, and brands to bring their visions to life—faster, smarter, and more affordably than ever before.
