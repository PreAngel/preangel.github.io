👋 Hey there — Huan here, solo founder currently building PreAngel, an AI-native, one-person incubator.

I’m focused on exploring what it means to **co-build with agents** from day one — not just bolting on AI, but designing workflows, tools, and interfaces around human-AI collaboration as the core architecture.

I also run **Ship.Fail**, a hackathon-style lab for rapid one-day product experiments. Think “build fast, fail forward, learn out loud.”

My background blends product architecture, language UX, and agent orchestration. If you're working on **AI-native tools**, **solo founder systems**, or experimenting with **multi-agent coordination**, I’d love to connect, jam, or swap ideas.

Looking forward to learning from this group 🙌

**What I can help with:**  

- Building AI-native products with agents  
- Solo founder systems & small bets strategy  
- One-day hackathon sprints ([Ship.Fail](https://ship.fail) style)  
- Prompt + interface co-design  
- Architecting human-AI workflows that feel collaborative

# About Huan Li

**I’m a solo founder architecting AI-native tools — working with agents, not just algorithms.**

---

I run **PreAngel**, an AI-native, one-person incubator focused on building tools that help humans and machines communicate more fluently. My approach blends **agent-based architecture**, **human-AI interaction design**, and **narrative-driven systems**. Everything I ship starts with the assumption that **AI is not a feature — it's a co-founder**.

Through **Ship.Fail**, I lead a hackathon-style community for rapid product experimentation. We explore ideas through one-day builds, small bets, and fail-forward iterations — all in the open.

## Life Beyond Code

I love skiing, salsa, MMA, paragliding, and anything that pushes the body to match the mind’s pace.
