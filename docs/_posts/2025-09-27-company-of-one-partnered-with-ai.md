> One human. Many agents. Infinite experiments.

Hi, I’m Huan — the **Founding Human** behind [PreAngel](https://pre-angel.com), a one‑person startup incubator that doesn’t build alone.

At first glance, PreAngel might look like a solo venture. But in practice, it’s a **company of one** working side by side with autonomous AI agents — named, role‑defined, memory‑augmented, and deeply integrated into how I design, build, and ship products.

Together, we’re building tools like:

- **ReKey** — an AI-powered keyboard that rewrites your English to sound fluent, natural, and expressive.
- **ReMic** — a real-time, bilingual voice interpreter that bridges spoken communication between humans.

These aren’t just “AI features” glued onto legacy tools.  
They are **AI-native products**, architected from the ground up for a world where AI isn’t just a backend, but a partner.

## 🧠 AI-Native, Human-First

Every product I build starts with one question:

> *What happens when AI is the first teammate, not the last add‑on?*

At PreAngel, I focus on **AI-native product design**, rethinking UI, UX, and workflows to make AI feel collaborative — not controlling. I believe in **human‑AI interaction** that empowers the user, maintains agency, and builds trust.

Because the point isn’t just intelligence.  
It’s **fluency**. It’s **connection**.

---

## 🧩 Many Agents. One Architect

Under the hood, PreAngel runs on an **agent-based architecture**: modular AI agents with names, responsibilities, and role memory. I build tools using **AI agent orchestration** — managing conversation state, functional logic, and coordination between autonomous components.

It’s not just prompt engineering. It’s **multi‑agent system design** for real‑world use cases.

---

## 🚢 Ship.Fast, Fail.Forward

Beyond our flagship tools, I also run **Ship.Fail** — a sandbox for small, fast, weird product ideas.

The philosophy is simple:

- Build fast  
- Learn loud  
- Fail forward  

Some projects launch in a day. Some evolve. Some die with grace.  
But every one of them is a **small bet** — and each one teaches me something true.

This is my personal **build‑fail‑learn loop**. It’s where I stretch ideas, test assumptions, and sharpen product intuition.

---

## 🧱 Systems for a Company of One

To move fast alone, I’ve built internal systems that handle:

- Agent lifecycle & role config  
- Firebase-powered infrastructure  
- Stripe + Apple IAP monetization  
- Launch, growth, and user feedback loops  

These **solo founder systems** let me act like a full‑stack startup studio — without the startup bloat.

But more than systems, I build **stories**.

Whether it’s an AI interpreter or a rewrite keyboard, each product starts with a core **narrative** — about making people feel seen, heard, and more fluent in who they are.

That’s what I call **narrative‑driven product design**.

## ✨ Let’s Build the Future, Together

If you're a solo founder, AI builder, researcher, or agent explorer — let’s connect.

This new era isn’t about replacing humans.  
It’s about working **with AI** to build what was once impossible.

I believe in that future — and I'm shipping it, one small bet at a time.

Warmly,  
**Huan Li**  
*Founding Human & Architect @ PreAngel*

> If you've made it this far, thank you. For those curious about how I actually work and what I practice — here’s a peek into the skills I’ve been cultivating as I build PreAngel, ReKey, ReMic, and everything in between.

## 🧠 Founder Skill Tree — What I’ve Been Practicing at PreAngel

Sometimes, building a company of one means wearing every hat — architect, poet, operator, explorer. Below are the principles and practices I return to often as I build ReKey, ReMic, and whatever’s next:

### 🧠 **AI Native**  

**Designing products where AI isn’t an add-on — it *is* the architecture.**  
At PreAngel, every tool starts from an AI-first core, not a retrofit.

### 🤝 **Human AI Interaction**  

**Crafting systems where AI collaborates with humans, not replaces them.**  
Interfaces are designed to feel like partnerships, not command lines.

### 🧩 **AI First**  

**Building user experiences optimized for real-time, generative collaboration.**  
I rethink UI/UX through the lens of how LLMs respond, adapt, and fail gracefully.

### 💡 **Idea Incubation**  

**Turning raw sparks into testable products through rapid iteration.**  
Ship.Fail is my founder lab — a studio model built into a solo startup.

### 🌀 **Design Sprints**  

**Time-boxed creative bursts for validating bold product ideas.**  
At PreAngel, sprints drive momentum, clarity, and continuous shipping.

### 🔁 **Build Fail Learn Loop**  

**Shipping fast, failing publicly, learning deeply.**  
Every experiment at PreAngel fuels the next — from microtools to agent behaviors.

### ⚡ **One Day Product Building**  

**From concept to working MVP in 24 hours.**  
This is how I sharpen instincts, test assumptions, and move ideas forward without friction.

### 🛠️ **Solo Founder Systems**  

**Scalable workflows for building, shipping, and iterating as a team of one.**  
I automate and templatize everything from launches to feedback to learning loops.

### 🧘 **Fail Forward Product Mindset**  

**Using failure as a feature, not a flaw.**  
Ship.Fail is a philosophy — not just about surviving missteps, but growing through them.

### 🎯 **Small Bets Strategy**  

**Placing focused, minimal-risk bets across many ideas.**  
Instead of chasing unicorns, I explore multiple pathways and double down on signal.

### 🧬 **Narrative Driven Product Design**  

**Designing tools that tell stories, not just perform functions.**  
From interface copy to agent personalities, every product reflects emotional clarity and intent.
